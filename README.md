# Open Source 2FAS Browser Extension

This is the official Browser Extension for the Open Source 2FAS project.

## What is 2FAS?

2FAS (Two-Factor Authentication Service) is a user authentication method that provides an additional layer of security for online accounts. In addition to a username and password, 2FAS uses a second factor, such as a one-time password (OTP) shown on a user's phone, to verify a user's identity. This helps prevent unauthorized access to accounts, even if a password is compromised.

## Features

- Connecting the 2FAS Browser Extension with the 2FAS Auth app
- Sending push notifications to 2FAS Auth app
- Automatic entering 2FA tokens sent by 2FAS Auth app
